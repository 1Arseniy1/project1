<h1 id="title1">Johannes Itten</h1>
<p><b>Johannes Itten</b>(11 November 1888 – 25 March 1967) was a Swiss expressionist painter, designer, teacher, writer and theorist associated with the Bauhaus (Staatliches Bauhaus) school. Together with German-American painter Lyonel Feininger and German sculptor Gerhard Marcks, under the direction of German architect Walter Gropius, Itten was part of the core of the Weimar Bauhaus. Itten has gained worldwide fame for the Bauhaus propaedeutic course he created (Vorlehre), which has become the basis of teaching in many modern design schools.</p>
<h2 id="title2">Life and Work</h2>
<p>Itten was born in Südern-Linden, Switzerland. In 1909 he enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts in Geneva but was unimpressed with the educators there and returned to Bern. Itten's studies at the Bern-Hofwil Teachers' Academy with Ernst Schneider proved seminal for his later work as a master at the Bauhaus. From 1919 to 1922, Itten taught at the Bauhaus, developing the innovative “preliminary course,” which was to teach students the basics of material characteristics, composition, and color.
    Itten's mysticism and the reverence in which he was held by a group of the students created conflict with Walter Gropius who wanted to move the school in a direction that embraced mass production rather than solely individual artistic expression. The rift led to Itten's resignation from the Bauhaus. From 1926 to 1934, he had a small art and architecture school in Berlin, where Ernst Neufert, the former chief architect of Walter Gropius at the Bauhaus, taught as well from 1932 to 1934.
    “Learning from books and teachers is like traveling by carriage, so we are told in the Veda. But, the carriage will serve only while one is on the highroad. He who reaches the end of the highroad will leave the carriage and walk afoot.” — Johannes Itten</p>
<h3 id="title3">Color sphere</h3>
<p>In 1920 Itten published a book, The Art of Color, which describes his ideas as a furthering of Adolf Hölzel's color wheel. Itten's so-called “color sphere” went on to include 12 colors.</p>

<p>Itten theorized seven types of color contrast and devised exercises to teach them. His color contrasts include:</p>
<ol>
<li>contrast by hue,</li>
<li>contrast by value,</li>
<li>contrast by temperature,</li>
<li>contrast by complements (neutralization),</li>
<li>simultaneous contrast,</li>
<li>contrast by saturation (mixtures with gray),</li>
<li>contrast by extension.</li>
</ol>
